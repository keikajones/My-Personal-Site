			<p>Name is Keika and been enjoying the concrete jungle of NYC for the past 2 years. Originally from the suburbs of Rockland County so the fast-paced environment of NYC definitely took some getting used to but now feel like I can sort of call myself a "New Yorker".</p><br>
			<P>Currently I'm enrolled at NYCDA in their Web Development Intensive course to hopefully start my career in coding! I feel like it's a the perfect outlet for my creativity and personality.</P><br>
			<p>I am a pretty introverted person but have broken out of that shell the past few years, especially living in NYC and meeting tons of new people. I love exploring the city, I consider myself a foodie and take up every opportunity to try a new place. And lastly I'm a huge dog lover, and this is my absolutely crazy insane dog Blue!</p></div>
